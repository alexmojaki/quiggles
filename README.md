All contributions are invited here! Submit issues with bug reports and feature requests. Come chat on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/alexmojaki/quiggles) and tell me what you like. Share your best drawings and I might display them in the Play Store. And of course, make pull requests! This is my first app and there's plenty of room for improvement. Any improvements to style and performance are welcome. See the issues for specific ideas. Or just add your own ideas which you think would be cool.
